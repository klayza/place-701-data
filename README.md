## What is this?

This repo contains the data for my essays, blogs, recipes, etc. that belong to my website: <a href="https://claycode.net">claycode.net</a>

## Why?

Because you can do something cool: control your entire website from your phone! Instead of uploading from an IDE, I use a simple and pretty markdown editor then git handles the rest!
