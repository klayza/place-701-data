The State of Learning
by Clayton Wieberg
 
For the first time in history, anyone can become an expert in anything for $0. We have devices that give us access to all of the world’s information, right at our fingertips, and algorithms that help us write essays, learn science, and make sense of the world around us. The pioneers of the information revolution would have thought today's world was pure fiction. Yet, most people seem oblivious to these possibilities. The traditional college path remains as expensive and misleading as it has always been. Meanwhile, a new, brighter path of informal learning is emerging, offering freedom, creativity, and affordability.

For me, college was no more fun than a funeral. There were many pointless boxes to check and no time to do the things I wanted to. All my real learning happened outside of it in the real world, building and breaking things. My approach has always been about “raising the ceiling”, or pushing the boundaries of what I can learn and achieve on my own terms. This mindset, while freeing, also comes with its challenges, especially when the reactions from those around you aren’t always supportive. But as I’ve continued down this road, the trajectory of my life has shifted in ways I never expected.

## Algorithmic Teachers

One of the key pieces to a quality education is a teacher. Now, for the very first time in history we can create digital people that can run entirely in our computers .... and can **understand** us. We can have conversations with Plato, ...


* validity,affordability,portability*


It's about time society reevaluates what learning means in today's world. High school graduates are expected to enter high school immediately after graduation despite that “only 13 percent of students feel fully prepared to choose their path after high school”[^1]. Education is being advertised as a way to escape poverty, when it is so much more than having a paper to prove you “know” something. A well-rooted education based not just on financial interest, but based on passion and curiosity will bring much more joy and quality to life that money cannot even begin to rival. Online resources are abundant and mostly free, however most of this information is scatted.  ~~~I talk about my experience in college vs, using pirating skills in free education,~~~


## How it Started

>[!Rambling?]

>As a software engineer, my job requires constant learning. Most of it is learning on the fly, usually googling for a piece of code and trying to fit it into a puzzle, or sometimes it is digging through deprecated docs or skimming through obscure videos on YouTube. I’m naturally curious about many things, which helps me gain understanding much quicker than if I were doing it for a letter grade. In high school I was one of the few people actually engaged in my coding class. Our teacher left the first week of school and we remained with an uninterested substitute for the rest of the year. Most of the time spent there was spent watching youtube videos or doing projects. The projects were always my favorite, and the second year teacher would check in every so often and impart some wisdom on us. He was the reason I would take my projects home and refine ... (note: am I rambling?).

>But I did a year and a half at a community college working towards a computer science degree but dropped out about halfway. A year after graduating high school I got a job as a software engineer and met some of the brightest people I’d ever known.
