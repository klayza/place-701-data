Landed in Kagoshima, everything went swimmingly and now it's time to get the bike put together.

This is the route I have planned. If the tunnels, landslides, or tsunamis don't kill me, my legs surely will cause the end of me.

Here be a quote.
> But after the end of the last ice age about ten thousand years ago, we discovered agriculture and domesticated animals, especially the horse, gradually raising our energy output to one or two horsepower. This set into motion the first great revolution in human history. With the horse or ox, one man had enough energy to plow an entire field by himself, travel tens of miles in a day, or move hundreds of pounds of rock or grain from one place to another. For the first time in human history, families had a surplus of energy, and the result was the founding of our first cities. Excess energy meant that society could afford to support a class of artisans, architects, builders, and scribes, and thus ancient civilization could flourish.
