## Day 70 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Olympia</p>

![image](0801-1.jpg)

After a week of driving around the Northwest Peninsula I made it back to civilization.

Got some fresh pizza and checked out an art exhibit.

## Day 71 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Seattle</p>

Biggest grocery haul yet. I'm a big fan in long lasting fresh food so I usually get carrots, potatoes, onions, celery, and brussel sprouts. Then plenty of dry food like rice, couscous, lentils, and quinoa.

Heading north now, thought I'd play one more round at my favorite arcade.

These guys were fun to play with. One of them even recognized my 2023 Tano*C Tour t-shirt! I was so happy because no sane person knows what that is.

## Day 72 <p class="inline text-gray-700 "></p>

Spent the day next to the coast. Listened to the Sam Harris' podcast and read.

## Day 73 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Vancouver, CA</p>

Goodbye USA, hello Canada!

I'm here at the International Buddhist Temple. Super cool seeing the intricate temples and sculptures. This was an actual temple and not some tourist hotspot because I was the only white person there. Plus the asian people gathering here seemed quite accustomed to the ritual of lighting their incense and bowing to the statue of a god.

At one point I was in a grand hall with about 30 monks in robes. I wasn't allowed to take photography so I found this photo online which took unusually long to find. They were chanting something while guests were gathering around and bowing their heads on small pillows on the floor. Very fascinating stuff.

Of course I had to check out the public library.

## Day 74 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Granville Island</p>

Found a parking spot downtown and went out exploring on my longboard.

Granville Island - a popular local market.

Apparently Vancouver is known for having good sushi. Regardless, I bought some. Did not disappoint.

I didn't want to cross that sketchy bridge again so I took a water taxi for just a couple bucks.

Went to Lynn Canyon Park in Northern Vancouver.

Listened to an audiobook by Exurb1a, a YouTuber who makes philosophical videos. If you also have the compulsion to abandon everything to live in a hut in the woods then I think this video is for you.

## Day 75 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Kamploops</p>

![image](0806-1.jpg)

Driving north to Banff National Park will take about 8 hours, so I stopped in the small town of Kamploops.

![image](0806-2.jpg)

Chilled at the public park for the rest of the day reading and sipping coffee. If you're interested in seeing what kind of books I read go here: <a href="/books">Books</a>

## Day 76 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Kamploops</p>

Boy is Canada a wonderful place. Do I really need to go back to the USA?

Believe it or not but I am sitting next to a real flat earther! I honestly didn't think these people were real! After a long, and meaningful conversation I finally saw the truth. Just kidding. She was a total nut case. Extremely nice though, and offered me steak. 

The first thing that made me suspicious was her stance on veggies. She was a pure carnivore and I thought to myself "Oh wow, how unique". I can't even remember her explanation for veggies being unhealthy it was so wild. Then she mentioned something about the flat earth society and it just spiraled into chaos from there.

After a long and arduous effort to rationalize with her, I gave up and began probing her as an individual, as it was fascinating how she had developed such an alien and hacky way of explaining the world around her (much like how the Greeks attributed simple natural phenomena, like the Earth's orbit or the changing seasons, to the work of the gods). So I attempted to inquire with her from a philosophical standpoint. She was doubtful about everything that seemed natural, and straightforward, and she only believed in conspiracy. It was as if I was talking to the complete opposite of a rational person. She shrouded her 'truth' with the idea that it was too complex to grasp, and that the only way I could begin to understand how “everything works and fits together” was by watching some 25 hour lecture by some obscure German professor. So my advice for talking to flat-earthers is to either not talk to them at all, or talk about building trust because of their immense distrust in science and consensus. Crazy.
