## Day 63 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Third Beach Trailhead</p>

<img src="/data/trips/west-coast-2024/attachments/0725-1.jpg">

Today I'm doing a hike along the coast. It's about 5 miles there an back.

This is the first time I'd done a hike on the beach. It was so cool. Occasionally I would see a few jagged rocks sticking out of the sand and there would be sealife around it.

Oh this is going to be fun... 

<img src="/data/trips/west-coast-2024/attachments/0725-6.jpg">

Just keeps getting better!

Finally got to the top! Beautiful views all around.

These are limpets, and you can eat them. Apparently they don't taste bad, but I don't think I can trust what the *starving* man says in the survival show.

Wallpaper material.

These guys are like landmines, you DO NOT want to step on them. Luckily I saw him in time so he got to participate in the photoshoot.

## Day 64 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Maymere Falls</p>

<img src="/data/trips/west-coast-2024/attachments/0726-1.jpg">

Did a small hike today, super crowded though. It's really hard to enjoy a hike when there is so much noise and commotion going on around you. Wasn't my favorite.

## Day 65 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Hurricane Hill</p>

Camped overnight right before the entrance to Olympic National Park.

<img src="/data/trips/west-coast-2024/attachments/0727-1.jpg">

I had heard good things about this trail so I wanted to get an early start before the hordes of people started flooding in.

The valley was starting to wake up.

Depression cured.

<img src="/data/trips/west-coast-2024/attachments/0727-8.jpg">

I gotta say, this place left me in awe. Before I started all of this traveling I saw this instagram video of someone around my age in a place like this, talking about living life completely free. It sort of stuck with me. About 5 months later and I am where the guy was standing. This was one of those moments where you know you will become nostalgic for this very point in time in the future. It felt amazing.

<!-- A wave of clarity washed over me. All of the fear or doubt I had in the beginning was justified, and it felt amazing.  -->

Oops, I don't have enough fuel to make it to the next gas station! Luckily I was on a hill, so I can just roll down, right? Not really. By the time I got to the bottom my breaks were starting to smoke. So yep, lesson learned. Got to a gas station without having to push my car like a dunce.

<img src="/data/trips/west-coast-2024/attachments/0727-11.jpg">

Made it to Port Angeles.

<img src="/data/trips/west-coast-2024/attachments/0727-12.jpg">

I got to town at the perfect time because there was a farmers market going on.

<img src="/data/trips/west-coast-2024/attachments/0727-13.jpg">

Tasted like home ðŸ˜­.

<img src="/data/trips/west-coast-2024/attachments/0727-14.jpg">

Found a cozy coffee shop and got some work done. When I mean work I mean fun coding projects lol.

## Day 66 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Victoria, CA</p>

<img src="/data/trips/west-coast-2024/attachments/0728-1.jpg">

Got some good rest because today was going to be long. I was taking a ferry to Victoria.

<img src="/data/trips/west-coast-2024/attachments/0728-2.jpg">

It was quite packed on board but I managed to find a good seat. I also got to see a crew member operating the anchor pulley which was neat.

*Pioneer, explore, voyage, adventure*. These are all terms that invoke a feeling of excitement and freedom. There's just an appealing glow to these words. Why is that? It depends on the person, but at the core it's the desire for novelty. For me it's gotta be adventure, or living on the fringe. I grew up watching a lot of adventure movies like Avatar, Journey to the Center of the Earth, The Martian, and my all time favorite: Atlantis - The Lost Empire (a 2001 Disney movie). Even some of my favorite songs talk about pioneering (Transcendence - Headhunterz/JDX). So in my experience, chasing the spirit of adventure is (dare I say) *euphoric*. Moments like preparing for a long backpacking trip, boarding a plane bound for a new remote country, or even realizing there are thousands of miles between you and your destination are all reflective of a true adventure.

The first place I went was Tim Horton's. $2 USD and it's so unreasonably good I can't even explain.

Lemon tart and a cherry pastry thing.

Sampling beer at noon on a Tuesday. Apparently they are big samples? Out of the rasberry, wheat, and strawberry beers I thought the wheat tasted the best. 

Unpopular opinion, but day drinking (on vacation) is AWESOME! When I [went to japan](/travel/japan-2023) I even got a large fizzing mug of lemon sour to compliment my fried udon breakfast. I couldn't think of a better way to start my day.

Trying freshly shucked oyster for the first time. It kind of tastes like you got a mouth full of ocean water but you're not thinking of all the fish poop and stuff that's in it. It tasted so good I ordered 3 more. Ginger and lemon pairs very well with it.

<img src="/data/trips/west-coast-2024/attachments/0728-12.jpg">

Went to check out Beacon Hill park before I had to take the ferry back.

Nodded off a couple of times on the hour-long ride back. Then got harassed by a U.S. border officer. :) 

## Day 67 <p class="inline text-gray-700 "></p>

Mental health day. (body broken from walking 10+ miles in tight sneakers)

## Day 68 <p class="inline text-gray-700 "></p>

Spent the day in the mountains.

<img src="/data/trips/west-coast-2024/attachments/0730-3.jpg">

There were berry bushes everywhere! These types are called Alaskan blueberries and they were very tart.

## Day 69 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Mt. Ellinor Summit</p>

<img src="/data/trips/west-coast-2024/attachments/0731-1.jpg">

Going on a beast of a hike today. 6.2 miles there and back, elevation **5,944** ft. The elevation gain is literally more than a mile â˜ . 

<img src="/data/trips/west-coast-2024/attachments/0731-2.jpg">
<img src="/data/trips/west-coast-2024/attachments/0731-3.jpg">

I was totally expecting to see slenderman peeking out from one of these trees. It was so spooky.

<img src="/data/trips/west-coast-2024/attachments/0731-6.jpg">

Finally made it out of the clouds. 

Unfortunately my jeans didn't make it any further. I had to hack them in half so my legs could breathe (I probably wouldn't have made it to the top it was so unbearable).

This was one of the coolest hikes I've ever done. It felt as if I was climbing a lonely island among a sea of snow.

<img src="/data/trips/west-coast-2024/attachments/0731-13.jpg">

<p class="text-center italic">Mt. Rainier in the distance.</p>

By the time I got down it was already 8pm! Day well spent.
