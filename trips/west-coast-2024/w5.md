## Day 29

![[0527-1.jpg]]

Myrtle beach, near Crescent City, CA. 

> 18:22
> Went to Myrtle beach and swam! The water was a beautiful turquoise color and quite clear. It was quite deep as well, the deepest parts were about 30 feet, the most I got to was 20 but just warming up until I get to Tamolitch falls or small Crater lake. About 10 minutes in the water when I was acclimated to the cold temperature I really started getting into it. My heart rate had slowed, muscle movement smoothed, and I got this somewhat of a euphoric feeling while on the bottom of the lake. I was climbing a giant sand hill and just felt incredibly energized. I wish I could stay down here forever.

Went swimming here. Saw a dad and his daughter gearing up in wetsuits when I strolled up in flipflops and basketball shorts. I jumped in and it stung bad. Got over it, and dove down to the bottom which was about 20ft. Probably swam for 20 minutes before I felt oddly warm, like a feint sense of false warmth. Hopped out and soaked in some sun on the beach for a while.

Turns out the frigid water was about 55F! Hypothermia sets in at below 40F. Good to know.

Melted into my cheap camping chair watching nature's performance.

## Day 30

![[0528-1.jpg]]

Waking up completely alone on a mountain top is like waking up to find yourself on the moon. I can see why people escape into the mountains and become hermits.

Heading to Oregon caves today!

![[0528-2.jpg]]
![[0528-4.jpg]]

This is a marble cave, which are fairly rare in North America. 

![[0528-5.jpg]]
 
Historic cave grafitti over 100 years old. 

![[0528-6.jpg]]

Elijah Davidson, the founder of the cave discovered it in 1874 while chasing his dog. He went in with only a matchbox, and at one point he ran out of matches and was completely lost. Luckily he found his way out after several hours, but I can't imagine how terrifying it must have been to be completely alone without any vision.

(spoiler alert: this happens to me later on in another cave)

![[0528-8.jpg]]

This stuff is called glowstone. I tried my hardest not say: "What? They took that from Minecraft!"

![[0528-9.jpg]]

Took a hike after the cave tour. Talked to an old man about beautiful things. He seemed to like clouds a lot.

![[0528-13.jpg]]

Found a spot for the night on a national forest development road.

![[0528-10.jpg]]
![[0528-11.jpg]]

Saw a black bear walk across this road.

Totinos pizza be hittin. Totally drenched it in sriracha.

## Day 31

Heading to Crater National Park today.

![[0529-1.jpg]]
![[0529-2.jpg]]
![[0529-3.jpg]]

This bird is called a Gray Jay, or more appropriately, a camp robber. 

I left a plastic bag of hot pasta salad out in the snow to cool, and came back to find this guy pecking away at it! The bag held up, so luckily my day wasn't ruined.

![[0529-5.jpg]]

The spot for the night. Technically not allowed to stay here overnight, but I asked someone in the visitor center and they said it was cool as long as I was. That should be easy... 

## Day 32

![[0530-1.jpg]]

Driving to Bend, Oregon.

![[0530-2.jpg]]

Found a quiet camp spot right outside of Bend.

![[0530-3.jpg]]
![[0530-4.jpg]]

The only thing keeping me going is my addiction to Golden Curry. Seriously, this stuff can be found at any grocery store and is so incredibly good. 

## Day 33

![[0601-1.jpg]]

Spent a day doing nothing. Read almost 300 pages. Would do again.

## Day 34

![[0602-2.jpg]]

Have a friend who used to live in Bend. She recommended I go to the church service and meet some of her friends. As an introvert it's very easy to enjoy yourself without anyone else being around. And this is my default mode of thinking. So when someone asks me if I will be at x social event, I usually don't give them an answer, I say maybe. Admitedlly, no one likes this response. The correct response is "Yes!". Of course, no introvert would ever say that, but those irrational decisions that seem to go against every fiber of your being are necessary, it gets your lonely ass talking to people.

So now when I am asked if I will be attending a social event, I almost always say yes. I still writhe in pain like a lobster in a pot of boiling water, but once you get past the introductions and stuff it's all natural and easy.

![[0602-4.jpg]]

Found a garter snake near a river bank. I was trying to catch it and wondered how these non-venomous snakes defend themselves. Do they play dead? Hiss? Slither faster? Caught it pretty easily and found out how it's defenses work. Piss. They thrash their body and piss.

Ran into a friend who I met at Yosemite about 30 days ago. She was finding a job here in Bend to fund her travels for the next few months.

## Day 35

![[0603-1.jpg]]

Going further north to a spot called little crater lake.

![[0603-2.jpg]]
![[0603-3.jpg]]
![[0603-4.jpg]]
![[0603-5.jpg]]

Relaxed by the lake and ate lunch. Too cold to swim though :(

> 13:14
> Out of Bend, and back onto the road. I went to small crater lake and really enjoyed it. Currently chilling after having a delicious asiago-sourdough ham, cheese, tomato, and arugula sandwich. Is it due to malnutrition, or am I actually a good cook? Anyways, Iâ€™ve got to get to studying.
