Californian staple food.

An insightful book about the problems of smarter-than-human computers. To sum it up, it's not looking good for us. So remember to use your please and thank you's when talking to ChatGPT and you might be spared!

I finally caught him! It wasn't that hard, actually. They move as slowly and non-chalantly as people do in hot tubs.

It's called a Rough-skinned Newt. Fun fact they are toxic. Only if you put them in your mouth. (I didn't)

## Day 23

Thanks to the sun I would be able to watch The Office. From the moment sunlight photons strike the photovoltaic cells in my solar panels, they are converted into electrical energy via the photovoltaic effect. This direct current (DC) is then routed through an inverter, converting it to alternating current (AC), which travels along conductive cables to my computer's power supply. Here, the electrical energy is utilized to power the computer's circuits, enabling the digital processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) to decode and reassemble binary data into coherent video frames, which are ultimately rendered on the display screen as the show "The Office."

Beyond the dirt lot I was comfortably parked on was a 70ft cliff into sharp ocean rock. Wouldn't even complain if I woke up in the middle of the night to hear my breaks go out and realize I forgot the parking brake... cause that view is killer.

There is this thing I like to do that helps for remembering settings like this. It's kind of like a meditation. You go through all five of your senses and focus on each of them. What do you see? Hear? Smell? Feel? Taste? It's proven worthwhile since I started doing it as a kid.

I figured out how to convert videos to gifs easily thanks to Ffmpeg. It quickly converts 200MB+ 4k videos to nice and small web-safe videos. Thank you OSS.

At Trillium falls trail near northern California. Met a lady who was whistling, singing, and just being loud. I asked why, and turns out that's how you stay safe from bears. Bears will usually smell or hear you before you can, but not all the time. If you are downwind from a bear they will never smell you, and if you are a lone hiker they likely won't hear you either. The only time they attack is if they are startled.
