## Day 96 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Nowhere</p>

![image](0827-2.jpg)
Driving south. Currently in the middle of nowhere in Wyoming. Sleeping overnight here was NOT fun. I'm pretty sure there was a [wendigo](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/wendigo) waiting outside my home on wheels.

## Day 97 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Fossil Museum</p>

In the middle of this desert of nothing was a wonderful little fossil museum. Apparently this boring desert was a biological hot spot millions of years ago. There was a massive lake which many animals thrived, and a special thing about it was the lake's layer of muck on the bottom that sealed the fallen organisms into a time capsule.

## Day 98 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Salt Lake City</p>

Exploring the city today. I usually like to start my mornings with coffee and writing, it lets me think clearer.

Ok, so this is probably the best cream soda I've ever had. Found it at some old gas station in the middle of nowhere. So incredibly happy.

At the city's public library. Also, shout out to public libraries. I've been to more in the last few months than any person probably does in a decade, and I've came to the conclusion that they are fucking rad! It's unfortunate that homelessness is such a serious problem, and they are all shunned for being this way, but at libraries, it seems most of them really respect the rules there and are reading a lot. I'm just glad there is still a place for anyone to go and learn, no credit card required.

Did nothing except play Subnautica today.

## Day 100 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Cafe Day</p>

Mostly spent the day on the computer, learning about [Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

## Day 101 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Reading Day</p>

![image](0901-1.jpg)

Found this sick hoodie! It's made out of merino wool so odors and stains stick around less. A bit pricey though.

Spent the rest of the day at a park reading :)

Thanks for reading as always, expect one or two more posts before this series concludes.
