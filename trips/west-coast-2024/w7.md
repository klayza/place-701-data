## Day 43 <p class="inline text-gray-700  font-thin">Hoyt Arbortoreum</p> 

![[0611-1.jpg]]

Went to the Hoyt abortorium (tree museum) today and saw, uh, trees. I learned a little bit about how to forests work up here. Mostly firs and pines. A lot of my tree knowledge comes from video games which is funny. I think video games are getting a better rep now that they are so easy to make and people are seeing cool things that they didn't think were possible.

I found a flower that had the same name as my favorite artist (<a href="https://g.co/kgs/SY4rdSc">Camellia</a>).

![[0611-4.jpg]]

This is a *banana slug*. You have to be careful not to step on these little guys or they will explode like a water balloon! 

## Day 44 <p class="inline text-gray-700  font-thin">Cougar (the town)</p>

![[0612-1.jpg]]

Lounging about next to the lake for the entirety of the day because who gonna stop me?

![[0612-2.jpg]]

One of the best feelings is to be lost in focus and wake up hours later realizing you forgot to eat or drink.

## Day 45 <p class="inline text-gray-700  font-thin">Ape Cave</p>

Today I had the idiotic idea of doing a 3 mile hike 200 feet below the surface in a lava tube, completely alone.

![[0613-1.jpg]]
![[0613-2.jpg]]

There were only a couple other parked cars outside of the cave. Oh great, I might *actually* do this alone.

![[0613-3.jpg]]

I walked down this huge rusty staircase into ape cave and saw some people down there. It looked like they were coming back from the lower hike. I was doing the upper hike which was much longer and more strenuous as there would be some bouldering and rope climbing involved. It was also in the complete opposite direction.


![[0613-vid.mp4]]

About halfway through the cave I found myself in a large room that was about 75ft in diameter. I stopped here to have a snack and... try an experiment. How long could I last without the light on before a cave monster inevetably gobbled me up? I gave it a go, and flipped my headlamp off. 1 second, 2 seconds, 3, 4, 5... NOPE! I frantically reached for the headlamp to turn it on and scare away the monsters lurking in the shadows. I've played so many many horror games that I have jumpscares seared into my brain (thanks FNAF). 

Besides the terrifying experiment, it's incredibly surreal being isolated from society by thounsands of tons of rock above you. Caves are just these mysterious holes in the surface of the earth that are entirely devoid of light. Deep sea trenches share more in common with caves than the surface. According to the National Caves Association, only 90% of caves on earth have been discovered! And the life that inhabits these tunnels would appear alien to any surface dweller. Most of the organisms that live down here are blind and allocate their energy to feeling around or using echolocation, which is again, analagous to the deep sea and their residents. What a beautiful place (when you're not alone).

![[0613-4.jpg]]

There was a psychological game that I sort of played while down here. The game was about not looking back. If you looked back then you would be more afraid. If you didn't look back you were only less afraid. If you didn't think of looking back at all, then you win. This game was exhausting.

![[0613-5.jpg]]

The features of the wall changed quite often, revealing patterns that you might only see on an alien ship.

![[0613-6.jpg]]

The rope I climbed was secure. Luckily my climbing skills from playing "<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Forest_(video_game)'>The Forest</a>" helped me out. (I only climbed like 10ft)

![[0613-7.jpg]]

Further down the cave I came across a hole in the ceiling and graciously took in all of the sun I could get. 

![[0613-8.jpg]]

Time to march on...

![[0613-9.jpg]]

Cool reflective ceiling pattern.

![[0613-10.jpg]]

Finally! The exit was in sight! I just had to pray there were no monsters waiting for me beside the ladder. 

![[0613-11.jpg]]

Hiking back to my car from the surface. I never appreciated how wonderful it was to walk in the sun!

![[0613-12.jpg]]

Took a lunch break and headed to my next hike for the day. This was at the foot of Mount Saint Helens, called Ape Canyon.

![[0613-13.jpg]]

In 1980 when Saint Helens erupted it caused a large runoff of rock, mud, and ash. It cleared many of the surrounding trees but in the 40+ years since then, most of it has grown back. (You can tell by the younger trees surrounding the mountain)

![[0613-14.jpg]]
![[0613-15.jpg]]
![[0613-16.jpg]]

In the distance is Mount Adams. I would pass by it in the near future.

## Day 46 <p class="inline text-gray-700  font-thin">Lewis River</p>

![[0614-1.jpg]]

Made my morning coffee and headed off to Lewis River Falls, which was a popular place to cliff jump and swim.

![[0614-2.jpg]]

Due to there being nobody around and the water being unusually chilly, I decided not to swim. I headed on to find a place to spend the night.

![[0614-3.jpg]]
![[0614-4.jpg]]
![[0614-5.jpg]]
![[0614-6.jpg]]

Settled into a small clearing next to a stream and fell asleep instantly.

## Day 47 <p class="inline text-gray-700  font-thin">Backroads</p>

![[0615-1.jpg]]

Today was the day I would make my journey through the mountains of Cougar to a small town called Randle, which would get me to Seattle. Unfortunately, it was raining, which meant there is a possibiliy there would be snow, and I've never driven through snow before. There were no other options to get there as most other forest service roads were still closed due to winter snow, and the highway was in the direction I came from. And besides, the highway it's lame. 

![[0615-2.jpg]]
![[0615-3.jpg]]

Wow, this snow sure is building up fast... *god help me*.

![[0615-vid.mp4]]

Despite the growing fear of becoming stuck and turning into a human popsicle, it felt magical driving through this winter wonderland.  

![[0615-4.jpg]]

Hooray! I love unstable, rocky, and pothole covered dirt roads!

![[0615-5.jpg]]
![[0615-6.jpg]]

I celebrated being alive with a warm rasberry pinwheel and hot chocolate. Life couldn't get any better than this.

## Day 48 <p class="inline text-gray-700  font-thin">Seattle</p>

![[0616-1.jpg]]

This guy thought he was hidden from me, or he was wondering why some idiot in a van stopped to wake him for a photoshoot.

![[0616-2.jpg]]
![[0616-3.jpg]]

Made it to Seattle! 

![[0616-4.jpg]]

The first thing I did was head straight to the arcade I had my eyes set on for the last month. Round1 Arcade. The only place on the west coast with the only game I cared about in the whole wide world. The game? Sound Voltex. Sound Voltex is a rhythm game with six indidual buttons and two twisty knobs. You have to click all the notes while operating the lasers, and sometimes you do all of this with one hand! It's a crazy looking game initially but it's so much fun! I love it so much I even bought a smaller game controller to play at home.

This is just preview of what insanity looks like.


![[0616-5.jpg]]

After a long and exhausting day of twisting nobs and tapping buttons I decided to retire for the night in a parking space next to the beach.

## Day 49 <p class="inline text-gray-700  font-thin">Elliot Bay</p>

![[0617-1.jpg]]

I explored the neighborhood and found some really cool gardens.

![[0617-2.jpg]]

I checked my recommended news and a hiker in Cougar was stalked by a cougar! On the same trail that I did! He reported it to the forest service and it showed up on the town of Cougar's facebook page. Pretty scary to think about.

Thanks for reading this week!
