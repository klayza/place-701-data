Driving to Yosemite.

Good song to listen to rolling through the hills.

<p class="text-center italic">Bridalveil Falls</p>

Found another one of my species! She goes by <a href="https://instagram.com/_catmobile_">Cat Mobile</a> and yep there are cats in there. Two of them. And they like to go on walks! I'd be scared of hawks though...

There wasn't too many people out here on Monday so it was nice to sit and just listen. 

![[0506-6.jpg]]

Yosemite falls can be heard throughout the valley. It's relentless during the spring. There's a constant hum to the falls beating down on the rocks below that sticks with you even once it's out of range.

"A Walmart Supercenter would look great here!" - The internet

![[0506-10.jpg]]

There was like 10 other van lifers down here just outside of Yosemite. Making spaghetti. 

## Day 9

![[0507-1.jpg]]

This routine of waking up and looking outside my home-on-wheels-with-zero-rent at a completely jaw dropping view is honestly pretty amazing. 

![[0507-2.jpg]]
![[0507-3.jpg]]

No, please! Don't peck at my wires! You can't make a nest out of that!

![[0507-4.jpg]]

First hike and we are at Vernal Falls. A light 3 mile hike with just an extraordianry climb through a mossy forest and alongside the raging Merced river. During the last stretch you are climbing these large blocky granite steps while being misted by the falls which is about 100 feet away. The moss growth near the walls were very pretty as well.  

![[0507-5.jpg]]

A light snack of Ritz crackers and tuna. Not exactly my top pick but their cheeze whiz was $8! Maybe it was for the best... and a few more years of my life...

![[0507-6.jpg]]

The trail (Mist Trail) keeps going all the way to Half Dome (Yosemite's most well known mountain). Too bad it was closed.

![[0507-7.jpg]]
![[0507-8.jpg]]

Finally back and managed to score a camping spot. Having some more avocado toast. You know as they say: When in Rome, Do a... (point made) 

![[0507-9.jpg]]
![[0507-10.jpg]]
![[0507-11.jpg]]

Slept like a baby.

## Day 10

![[0508-1.jpg]]

I am just not getting sick of this stuff. This is like the 9th ham and spinach quesadilla I've had this trip. Another van lifer I met said he ate fajitas for dinner every night for a month straight.

![[0508-2.jpg]]

This has got to be my **favorite** view of Yosemite. For two reasons. 
 1. It's massive and makes me feel like an ant.
 2. It's distinct black streaks of varnish.

Jacob Geller, a Youtuber who creates video essays about video games that go surprisingly deep, made a video that's called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDrHpmkL4rY">Three Specific Kinds of Terror</a>. One of the fears is about big things. And of course I wasn't trembling or anything at the sight of a mountain, but he does speak about some rather profound ideas. I won't explain too much but I'd just like to leave this here.


![[0508-3.jpg]]

The varnish is actually a thin layer of minerals and organic matter that accumulates on the surface of rocks over long periods and are stained by flowing water.

<p class="text-center italic">Half Dome</p>

![[0508-6.jpg]]

About halfway through my hike to Yosemite point. 2 miles and 1,200 more feet to climb!  

![[0508-7.jpg]]

Wallpaper material right here.

Never would have seen the mountain ranges from the valley or even driving through. The 4 mile hike up was well worth the price of admission.

![[0508-11.jpg]]

Had some lunch here. This totally beats every other place I've eaten at. The only places that could top this would be The Tree of Souls from Avatar or the bow of the Titanic, neither of which exists... VR will get there one day.

![[0508-12.jpg]]

There was another trail that went along around the cliffsides called Panoroma trail. It required backpacking gear and a permit though. 

![[0508-13.jpg]]


![[0508-14.jpg]]
![[0508-15.jpg]]

8 miles and 4k feet climbed. Clocking out for today...

![[0508-16.jpg]]
![[0508-17.jpg]]
![[0508-18.jpg]]

The river rapids were comforting to fall asleep to. 

## Day 11 

Heading out to San Francisco next. I could totally spend a week or two here but I need some backpacking gear if I want to do any of the 'better' hikes.

![[0509-1.jpg]]
![[0509-2.jpg]]

These rolling hills were beautiful. I can totally imagine a golden retriever prancing through these fields.

![[0509-3.jpg]]

Got to San Jose late at night around 11pm and was surprised at how many shops were still open. Night life is so underrated. Tokyo had it figured out.

## Day 12

![[0510-1.jpg]]

Getting some work done in a vibrant coffee shop called Red Rock coffee. 

![[0510-2.jpg]]

This was in Palo Alto. Lots of asian shops.

While I was here working a lady sitting next to me noticed my shirt which only had Japanese characters on it (日本語は話せません). It reads "I don't speak Japanese", which is true but I can read and speak a little. She happened to be studying Japanese literature and was just a treasure chest of knowledge on things like getting a tutor, and how to live and travel Japan cheaply. All of which might be what I do after this trip.

Finally at the computer history museum! 

![[0510-3.jpg]]

The world of computing is pretty amazing, especially in the field of programming. At some points in design you will find yourself lost in a space of abstraction. A space where anything can be molded from the abstract. It's not just an idea or a thought, but a blob of truth. It must be felt and imagined at all angles, and decorated with interpretation. And only once this snippet of truth is etched into silicon and assigned a computer, can you can build something amazing. Whether it be a device to record biological signals or a simple redstone mechanism in Minecraft, each stems from a common truth. 

Read "The Beginning of Infinity" for more... in case that wasn't enough.

Hacker Dojo - where software developers, entrepreneurs and alike come to collaborate and break things. 

## Day 13

![[0511-1.jpg]]

Most silicon valley banner ever.

![[0511-2.jpg]]
![[0511-3.jpg]]

This was an amazing cafe called Blue Bottle Coffee that had a really good space for working. 

## Day 14


![[0512-1.jpg]]

Super super good book that I happened to be reading at the same time as this guy. I also told him that. (This felt like one of those times where you see someone wearing the exact same t-shirt as you) 

![[0512-2.jpg]]

Third day in San Francsico and yet again at another coffee shop. Like what else is there to do here?
