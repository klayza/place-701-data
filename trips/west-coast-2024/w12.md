## Day 77 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Road to Banff</p>

![image](0808-1.jpg)

Another day of driving, yay. It's actually not the worst. I have plenty of podcasts I've ripped from youtube. Tim Ferris' Waking Up, Mindscape with Sean Caroll, Sam Harris, and the Lex Fridman podcasts are my favorites right now.

Seems like I pulled up at the right time, it was fun watching them.

When looking for these spots online I've noticed a trend that people usually comment about being mindful of bears. It's a little scary to think that we live with these half-ton beasts roaming around in the woods that could rip into you at any moment. I don't mind it but it's just a bummer I am too afraid to stay outside past dark for longer than a second.

## Day 78 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Banff National Park</p>

Today I got about 3 hours of driving north until I hit Banff.

Yeah, I think I'm in love with these big rocks. Sometimes I catch myself looking up at them with a big stupid grin, people must think I'm on something.

Made it to the top! It was just about 6km, or ~3.5mi. Canada uses the metric system, so I had to get used to it. Anyways, the pools up here were called clay pots because they were dyed with a substance that seeped in from an underground cavern that dyed the pools a turquoise blue. Pretty neat.

Jumped into the river and basked in the sun for a bit.

Checkout out Banff on my longboard.

A magpie! I've seen these birds online doing tricks but never irl. So cute.

## Day 79 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Tim Horton's</p>

If I were put onto death rown tomorrow this would be my last meal. Tim Horton's just knows how breakfast works. You get coffee, a maple bacon crossiant sandwich, and a honey crueller for $5. Perfection.

I got the same meal three consecutive days in a row.

I'm checking out the palace thing and going to spend some time reading here.

After getting some work done at a cozy starbucks this is was the view. So pretty.

## Day 80 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Wunderlust Trail</p>

![image](0811-1.jpg)

Waking up has never been easier when you are half a block away from a Tim Horton's.

Got some breakfast and left Banff going south. Stopped at a lake to read. Man, you picked the wrong blog, cause all I do is lounge around and read so you might as well go take a trip to the retirement home to get the same level of excitement. But all I hope is that you get a chuckle out of my ramblings and maybe learn some odd fact.

A huge bug popped out from the window crack. Seems like he found a nice cozy spot under the door trim. Unfortunately we share the same environment when I am lounging about with my doors open and fail to notice the busloads of critters shuttling into my premises. Again, I couldn't care less that there could be a family of tarantulas living under my bed, as long as I can't see it then it doesn't bother me. However, there was this one time I woke up with a huge spider bite on my leg about the size of a quarter, it only throbbed a little bit.

[*insert fact about the canadian rockies*] Nope. Let's tangent. I just spent the last 3 hours reading 100 pages of the most abstract and unintelligable philosophy book ever. And it's an introductory book! Supposedly from the so called experts on the internet in order to completely understand topics in depth you should read philosophy textbooks **four** times over! What the hell! I admit I might be a little boring, but I'm not that dead! So anyways, I'm going to finish this entry and publish it before I miss my self proclaimed deadline.

> 08/11
> On the drive down the 40 I was thinking, “Wow, I saw two bears already, I wonder if I could find anoth-”, and then I saw this moving bush thing going up the hill beside the highway and realized it was a bear! What are the odds! Couldn’t tell if it was a grizzly or not, but I think I’ll stick with that when I’m telling stories to my great grandchildren. Then I made my way to some lake and jumped in. It hurt, but I felt so calm afterwards, like an Egyptian taking 4 cold baths a day. Afterwards I laid out on the beach taking in the mountain view. 

## Day 81 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">U.S. Border</p>

Last day in Canada. Had my last banquet at Tim Horton's and trudged further south.

Cleared my stash of hard cider before going back into the USA. (future clayton note: u.s. customs is too lazy to check your cargo if they close in 10 minutes )
