## Day 56 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Downtown Seattle</p>

![[0625-1.jpg]]

Waking up to this is perfect. I get to open my front door to the crisp morning air of Seattle and the fragrance of the flower gardens from all of the rich people atop the hill. But the one downside is traffic, if I sleep in too late the noise of the cars passing by will start seeping into my dreams and it will drive me crazy.

At the Museum of Pop Culture.

Such a vibrant entrance, popular music was playing, lighting was very nice, and I even scratched in a few notes detailing the screen's layout (I am a design freak what can I say?).

Poor Master Chief.

When I was a kid I was obsessed with the hover board from Back to the Future. I thought it was real! And I wanted to be the cool kid that could fly to school! When scouring ebay for a 'legit' hoverboard I asked my parents to help but was crushed when the truth was laid on me. After sulking for a while I kept looking and found a REAL hoverboard that was made out of magnets. Tony Hawk actually rode it and my brain sort of did a flip.

Here's the legendary video of Tony Hawk on a hoverboard:

I love huge satellite dishes.

Pike marketplace. It's a popular place to visit in Seattle.

## Day 57 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Seattle Public Library</p>

Heading to probably one of the most beautiful libraries I've ever been to.

![[0626-2.jpg]]

Parking was a nightmare. I parked like a mile away in some dirt lot.

![[0626-3.jpg]]

This place was awesome! The top floor was for reading and I was about the only person up there! It rained a bit too which made it more cozy. I could honestly do this for another few days, but tomorrow I am flying home. 

## Day 58 <p class="inline text-gray-700">Flying Home</p>

![[0627-1.jpg]]

What a sad day to be leaving my favorite place. I'm going to make the most of it... with video games!

![[0627-2.jpg]]

I'm going to miss you baby...

![[0627-3.jpg]]

Hope you're still there when I get back!

## Day 59 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Home (on wheels)</p>

![[0721-1.jpg]]

Hooray! It's still here! And there are no hobos or racoon families living in it!

![[0721-2.jpg]]

After a long day of grocery shopping and planning, I made the sandwich of gods using the best bread ever. (Seattle brand cracked wheat sourdough)

## Day 60 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Starbucks</p>

Workin' and readin' day.

## Day 61 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Quinault Trail</p>

![[0723-1.jpg]]

Doing a quick morning hike.

![[0723-2.jpg]]
![[0723-3.jpg]]

There were so many berries here I was just waiting to turn the corner and see a bear.

![[0723-4.jpg]]

Going further north.

![[0723-5.jpg]]
![[0723-6.jpg]]
![[0723-7.jpg]]

Found a beautiful, quiet spot. I could still smell the saltiness of the ocean here as the winds were quite strong. 

## Day 62 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Ruby Beach</p>

![[0724-1.jpg]]

Going to Ruby beach. 

![[0724-2.jpg]]

<p class="text-center m-auto w-full italic">The Tree of Life.</p>

Looks like he was enjoying a nice snack.

Found a quiet spot for the night.

![[0724-10.jpg]]

Right next to where I was parked there was a short trail that took you to a river bank. And it was beautiful! 

![[0724-11.jpg]]

The water was a murky turquoise color. I spent a good amount of time down here reading but regret not jumping in. (It was so cold, but would have felt refreshing.)

![[0724-12.jpg]]

A guy and a group of his friends came by and asked if they could spend the night on the river bank. I didn't mind it. They told me they come to this spot every year to celebrate one of their birthdays. They were really nice, and even offered me a beer! I thought that nothing else in the world could have tasted better than this one beer delivered by God himself.
