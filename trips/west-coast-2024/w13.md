## Day 82 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Glaicer National Park</p>

Early wake up today. Need to get into Glacier Park before their fee booth opens.

The air was chilly, the glow of the rising sun trickled onto the frigid waters, all is quiet, all is sound.

Parking was insane. Got there at 6:30 and it was FULL! I had to go find a parking spot like half a mile away. Definitely the most busiest park I've been to.

This was such a beautiful hike through the Rocky Mountains. The wildlife was abundant, a myriad of wilfdlowers were showing off their colors, and the breeze was cool and refreshing.

This poor guy. I was with them for a bit and found it almost impossible not to burst out laughing so I had to bite my lip and rush past them. I couldn't help it! Anyone passing by saw my expression and had to look away too. A couple people would pass by and say something along the lines of "Dad of the year", or "Wow what a workout", and he would reply with "Yep, bad choice".

## Day 83 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Grinell Glacier</p>


![image](/data/trips/west-coast-2024/attachments/0814-1.jpg)

Today's the big day. I'm taking on the hardest hike yet.

![image](/data/trips/west-coast-2024/attachments/0814-2.jpg)

Got to the trailhead and found out that the beginning section was closed off! I had to take a mile detour around a lake which would mean that the hike was now 12 miles total! The most I've done was 13 miles, but that was backpacking on a flat trail. The trail today is definitely not flat and is actually 2,000 feet in elevation gain. This will be fun...

Before this hike I bought some hiking poles to try out for the first time. Absolutely saved me. I broke them out and just glided up the mountain.

A neat little waterfall. Plunged my head in to cool off. Cold and refreshing.

Made it to the top! The turquoise water and icebergs reminded me of the arctic. Never been, but scuba diving + ice caves sounds worthy of a trip someday, hmm.

On the road again. Heading towards Great Falls to resupply.

Ok that hike was kind of insane and now I'm wrecked. Made a light vegetable soup for dinner and crashed.

## Day 84 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Great Falls</p>

![image](/data/trips/west-coast-2024/attachments/0815-1.jpg)

Made it back to civilization. Did fun grown up things like laundry, grocery shopping, and got a car wash for the mountains of bugs on my windshield. 

## Day 85 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Public Library</p>

![image](/data/trips/west-coast-2024/attachments/0816-1.jpg)

Spent the day at the library reading a physics textbook. Why? Because learning is fun and makes life 100x more meaningful. 

One of my idols inspired me to pickup this book and start a journey of independent education. You can read more about it on their site: <a href="https://www.susanrigetti.com/physics">susanrigetti.com/physics</a>. It's probably one of the biggest leaps I've made, and already I've discovered some (relatively) profound things. I'll cover this more in depth in the future.

## Day 86 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Great Falls</p>

> 8/17
> Today was great! Went to the usual coffee shop, the crooked tree or something, got a coffee with chocolate syrup and a basil biscuit and cheese sandwich (mid) and improved the book section of my website. Now it pulls books from data.js instead of that dreaded md file, and uses openlibrary for getting book covers. And I finally fixed the manifesto. Also, last night I deleted youtube vanced and instagram so I didn’t use them at all today, besides that one instance where I might’ve looked up a video for opening a locked ford transit connect door, heh. But anyways, the website is looking spic and span now. Then around 1 or so I went back to my home and got some groceries from across the street. Then I went to riverside park where I made a delicious sandwich and read. Growing tired of the car noises I decided to head to the library to study. I read some [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Death's End]]. I got two weeks to finish both of them. ~1200 pages/14 days = 85 pages/day. Oh boy. My eyes are going to hurt for the next two weeks.

Fyi, these are snippets out of my journal. I've done them occasionally but just want to make it clear.

## Day 87 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Crooked Tree Coffee</p>

![image](/data/trips/west-coast-2024/attachments/0818-1.jpg)

Maybe spent the entire day at a coffee shop... so cozy there.

## Day 88 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Learning C.A.</p>

![image](/data/trips/west-coast-2024/attachments/0819-4.png)
<p class="italic text-center">Cellular Automata rule 101 / 255</p>

For most of the day today I just felt like building. I pulled up my favorite creator, *The Coding Train* and watched his tutorial on creating Cellular Automata, which in a nutshell is creating a digital life and watching them evolve. So fun.

Thanks for reading! As of writing this I am home now and wrapping up the last few weeks. So, stay tuned because the rest should be out before the end of this month (hopefully).
