## Day 89 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Livingston</p>

In the small town of Livingston currently. Getting some work done before I head to Yellowstone.

Left later in the day and was surprised by a huge storm rolling in over the mountains. It felt like driving through a pool at some points. Strong gusts and sharp rain drops, glad I made it through fine.

## Day 90 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Yellowstone</p>

Early admission to one of the first national parks in the country, could not have gotten a prettier sunrise.

About 50 mins of driving through the park and I see a coyote! Looks like he just found breakfast.

I begin my hike around the park and am walking next to the cliff that follows the Yellowstone river south.

I now believe in god. Someone just offered me free chocolate from a silver platter in the middle of a forest! (He was with a tour group, but wouldn't matter to me, anything sweet instantly becomes a banquet when you are on a long hike)

Try and find the duckling hidden in this photo!

Rested by this small lake with thermal vents, broke break and read.

Finished the hike and drove to West Thumb (part of Yellowstone). Found a nice place to chill by Yellowstone Lake.

## Day 91 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">West Thumb</p>

![image](0822-1.jpg)

Slept in big time today. Broke out the bacon and eggs then assembled a holy crossiant breakfast sandwich. While I was doing so I managed to attract the eyes of a large bus of girls (They were just passing by). Scored three or four "cool setup"s from them, so I think that is a sign I am at least doing something in life right.

Louged about for the rest of the day reading and taking small walks. Couldn't have been a better day.

## Day 92 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Boardwalk</p>

Checking out the main attraction of Yellowstone today, Old Faithful!

This geyser erupts every 20 minutes or so, it got the name because of how faithful it is to this estimate, given plus or minus 10 minutes.

Rotten egg smell all around, it was starting to get to me.

My favorite part of the day! Brewed some coffee and found a quiet spot down by the lake to do some reading.

Unfortunately a huge thunderstorm passed through and I was forced to flee.

Went swimming in the lake and spent read down by the beach. Unfortunately it didnâ€™t last very long because a thunderstorm came rolling through. At first I went to the small lake pavilion but realized my odds at being struck by lightning were much higher as the pavilion was all made out of steel and would be a nice place for god to chuck a thunderbolt at. So I went back to my cozy van and did some more reading (finished the Three Body Trilogy!!).

## Day 93 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Lax Day</p>

Today? Ain't nothing going on. I got 100+ hours of podcasts downloaded, let's just soak it in.

Listened to Lex Friedman x Pieter Levels. Very good.

## Day 94 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Grand Teton National Park</p>

![image](0825-1.jpg)

I AM NOT PAYING ANOTHER FEE BOOTH $35! I MUST GET IN FREE!

![image](0825-2.jpg)

Welp, there was no fee booth. I parked and slept for 4 hours. Woke up around 9 am, and by then it was a madhouse. Just moved on. ðŸ˜¢

## Day 95 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Sick Day</p>

![image](0826-1.jpg)

Eugh, I'm sick. Just rotted in my hot car, it was miserable. Got some tomato soup and a cold sprite to feel better.

That's all for this week!

I have been getting adjusted to being home after 4 months and it has been weird, hoping to finish off the rest of these weeks strong and move on to other projects. As always, thank you for reading!
