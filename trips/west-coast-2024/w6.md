## Day 36 <p class="inline text-gray-700  font-thin">Columbia River</p>

<img src="/data/trips/west-coast-2024/attachments/0604-1.jpg">

I am camped out right beside Mt. Hood. It is so cloudy out and I need to find sun to keep my refrigerator running!

Made it out of the mountains into the town of Hood which is along the Columbia River.

I had a quiet camping spot right next to the river! It was beautiful.

## Day 37

Today I am checking out a secret waterfall. (secret meaning it is under private property. but it's a logging company and nobody likes them so it's ok.)

It's sad that a comporation can own and legally destroy something as beautiful as this.

## Day 38

Starting today off with a hike. Quickly made some instant oatmeal and set off. I am hiking a trail called Wind Mountain Trailhead.

It was so windy up here. It was cool watching the birds effortlessly soar to thousands of feet. If reincarnation exists, I would like to reincarnate as either a river otter or a Peregrine falcon.

The Native Americans used this place as a spiritual training grounds where youth would stack large rocks and patiently wait for a vision to come to them. Once a vision was received, they were considered men.

## Day 39 <p class="inline text-gray-700  font-thin">Portland</p>

Made it to Portland! 

<img src="/data/trips/west-coast-2024/attachments/0607-1.jpg">

My first stop was a popular book store which was HUGE!

<img src="/data/trips/west-coast-2024/attachments/0607-2.jpg">

Now that I have a Kindle, bookstores are kind of like museums to me now. I just browse around and if I like it I write it down and have a bot find it on the web for me. Then I have it transferred to my Kindle, all for *free*.

Getting the famous Voodoo doughnuts at midnight because I am only human. Anyways, what the hell! The line was full! I thought I would be the only one, but apparently Portland has a pretty busy night life. I was in line with about 40 other people.

Got the booty and quickly made my way back home guarding this pink box with my life. I had to walk through a crowd outside of a night club and they made some remarks about my pink box that made me shiver. I scurried home in the shadows. 

What I got: mucho mango, buttermilk bar, and a grape donut. Fell into a sugar coma shortly after.

## Day 40

Slept right by a public park. The hobo rambling ASMR was on all night. I've got some work to do so I'm going to relocate and look for a coffee shop.

This place was so cozy. Tucked away in a quiet neighborhood by an array of oak trees covering the street with a lush green canopy.

## Day 41

<img src="/data/trips/west-coast-2024/attachments/0609-1.jpg">

The Witch's Castle. Right outside of downtown Portland. 

<img src="/data/trips/west-coast-2024/attachments/0609-2.jpg">
<img src="/data/trips/west-coast-2024/attachments/0609-3.jpg">

Drove back out to the Columbia River to do this one of a kind hike where you pretty much did switchback after switchback up a cliff.

Back in Portland, checking out some of the houses. I really like green houses like this. 100% self sustaining houses are not as difficult as they used to be. Solar, vertical farming, and atmospheric water generators have come very far in the past few years. I am excited for the day when I will have the cash to experiment with this high tech stuff.

## Day 42

<img src="/data/trips/west-coast-2024/attachments/0610-1.jpg">

Spent the entire day at a beautiful rose garden. Did some reading, and just relaxed soaking in the sun and the sweet smell of the fragrant flowers.

<img src="/data/trips/west-coast-2024/attachments/0610-3.jpg">

Reading The Character of Physical Law, by Richard Feynman. This stuff hurts my brain but is incredibly fascniating. (I read this June 10th, 2024. It is now August 1st as of writing this. I've built up a simple mental model after reading about it from different perspectives. Podcasts, scifi, blog posts, Youtube videos, and introductory books. Things are moving into place and making sense, at least generally. Next I will be diving into a textbook to understand it technically, so that will be fun. I am working on publishing my progress in tackling difficult subjects such as this, as it might be helpful for any other independent students out there.)

That is the end of this week, thank you for reading!
