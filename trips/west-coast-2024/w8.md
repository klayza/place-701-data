## Day 50 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Seattle</p>

Today is responsibility day. Got groceries and did laundry. Also downloaded all of the Alien movies to watch when I'm alone on Mt. Rainier.

## Day 51 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Rainier National Park</p>

![[0619-1.jpg]]

I am camped out right before the entrance of Rainier National Park. I set my alarm for 6:30 so I can get in before their fee booth opens and save $30!

I'm hiking the Glacial Basin trail which will take me to a glacier nestled up on a mountain beside Mt. Rainier.

Got to the end of the trail and broke out the snacks. There were some people going all the way up. They all had multiple layers, skiis, and ice cleats. I was just wearing a t-shirt and regular hiking boots so no chance I would survive a trip up there. It was fun watching people make their way up though.

This Gray Jay was just waiting for the camera to come out.

Twilight is my favorite time of day... the roads are quiet and open, the sky cascades with colors from amber, mossy green, to a midnight blue, and the silvery stars begin to dot the sky.

Went into hibernation after watching the sky's performance.

## Day 52 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Skyline Trail</p>

![[0620-1.jpg]]

Hey! Would you look at that! Just locked the doors and realized my keys weren't in my pocket! Wonderful!!

Called a ranger and an officer came within an hour and a half. He put a rod through the door crack and squeezed the keys out without breaking anything. He was cool, said it happens all the time.

I am hiking the Skyline trail which was about 4 miles there and back. There was so much snow and plenty more that ended up in my boots.

This is a marmot. Seemed like he was just enjoying the sun. Or sizing me up...

This place was a zoo and I didn't want to be here any longer.

Hike 2! Comet falls. 3.5 mi, 1,286 ft elevation gain.

This has got to be my tenth or so waterfall I have seen on this trip, and yet I still don't get bored of them. Despite their simple composition of just water falling from a higher altitude, they are immensely impactful as they can create micro ecosystems around them. Some starlings or swifts create nests behind waterfalls to avoid predators and parasites. Large families of moss and special trees thrive on the waterfall mist.

The cumulus congestus clouds are like mountains of the sky, dwarfing the rocky mountains in size.

## Day 53 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Wenatchee National Forest</p>

![[0621-1.jpg]]

Camped out in a remote forest next to a stream. I'm very surprised my van has made it this far lol.

![[0621-4.jpg]]
![[0621-2.jpg]]

Did some ass sledding. You can see the path I took in the snow. It was actually so much fun despite being a bit dangerous because of how steep it was. Would do it again.

![[0621-3.jpg]]
![[0621-5.jpg]]

Drove back to Seattle which was only like 40 minutes from Rainier National Park and got myself a delicious Seattle dog.

## Day 54 <p class="inline text-gray-700 "></p>

Literally did nothing except read today.

## Day 55 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Seattle Skyline</p>

![[0623-1.jpg]]

I spent the night here and woke up to this killer view for completely free! (legal too) Why isn't everyone buying a shitty van to travel out of? The only price for this spot was being woken up by some party bus at 2 am stopping here and blaring their subs loud enough to reach the other side of the bay. Got a chuckle out of it and passed out again.

Afterwards, I met the family that would be keeping my van for a month while I would be flying back home to go on another road trip, but this time with my family. We were heading to the midwest to visit some family and then a trip to Rocky Point. The husband was a philosopy graduate with a religious background, it was fun to talk with him as I just started reading some classic literature like Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, and On the Shortness of Life by Seneca.

## Day 56 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Downtown Seattle</p>

![[0624-1.jpg]]

Going to get Dim Sum for the first time with the woman who will be watching my van. We talked about our backgrounds and the things we liked to do. She wanted to be a teacher and was interested in Egypt when she was younger. Somehow our conversation drifted to theology (the study of god) and brushed into metaphysics (the study of being and knowning. think pothead questions like "Why is anything here at all?"). It was a lot of fun.

Slept beside a park with this as a view. Again... FREE!!

Thanks for reading!
