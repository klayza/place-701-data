## Day 102 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Driving South</p>

![image](0902-1.jpg)

Drove for about 6 hours today. Starting to feel a little more like home now that I am closer to Arizona. I think to myself, did I really live doing anything else other than this? This is my life now, but soon it won't.

Driving out here made me feel like a cowboy from the future. How do you think they would react to the idea of a solar powered fridge, on wheels powered by gasoline?

Made it to Arches National Park! Doing a big hike in the morning so need to get to sleep early.

## Day 103 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Devil's Garden</p>

Starting today by hiking Devil's Garden, a nice and easy 4 mile hike.

About an hour in the hike and I got lost! I found my way back easily, but it's not hard to find a false trail here.

This is exactly the kind of place I would expect a band of [Tusken raiders](https://www.starwars.com/databank/tusken-raiders) from Star Wars to pop out from the cliffs and ambush me.

Everything seems better after a hike, or exercise in general. It's the best ingredient for a meal, and necessary for a healthy mind. Spending too much time in the same building makes the world seem small, and bland. So it's best to hang with mother nature for a while, get back to your roots and get a little dirty in the process. (I type away on my keyboard for a living, so if I can do it, anyone can)

## Day 104 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Colorado Plateau</p>

Another day of driving ahead of me, luckily it's pretty as heck here. When you drive a lot, you have a lot of time to think to yourself. It's great in moderation, and it can help you understand your needs.

Those crags look almost like Godzilla's back spikes, what could possibly be below the surface?

Lots of climbing here, had to be careful.

Oh my god the light was so beautiful bouncing off the sandstone-cliff walls.

After a long hike through the canyons I went to Lake Powell to relax.

Nights like this I feel more awake than any other. With full awareness that tomorrow will bring the end of this life, I notice my senses are heightened, my breath and sight more vivid, the air is heavier. I don't want to let it go, with the end in sight time seems more valuable than anything.

## Day 106 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">The End</p>

![image](0905-13.jpg)

I'm happy I got to do this. I'm happy I got to share it online. This trip will serve as a time when I put my mind to something and made it happen, and hopefully a message to you to finally go do that one thing that's been bouncing around in your head forever.

This adventure was a dream for half my life, but it became reality after three things happened.

1. **Start with what you got**. I went tent camping a lot, went on weekend trips to new cities, all in a sedan.
2. **Eat, drink, and think it every day**. I read and watched everything I could about it, staying up late watching youtube videos, doing research, and looking for vans to buy. A good quote from Buddha: "What you think, you become".
3. **Don't half-ass it**. Instead of spending the night watching Netflix or playing video games, I went to work and built out my van. I had never built anything with my hands before but I sat out in my driveway watching YouTube and hammering wood together like an ape nearly every day for two months.

That's just what I believe tho, it's fun figuring things out for yourself.
